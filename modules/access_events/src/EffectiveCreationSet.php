/**
 * Computes the set of dates a series' CURRENT recur config would produce.
 *
 * This class replays contrib's date computation without persisting anything.
 *
 * Historical note: through recurring_events 2.x,
 * EventCreationService::createInstances() computed a series' full date set as
 * one inseparable step with CREATING AND SAVING eventinstance entities, and
 * there was no dates-only read path in contrib at all. 3.0 split that out into
 * EventCreationService::calculateEventSeriesDates() /
 * calculateDatesFromConfigArray(), which are equivalent to the replay below —
 * so the duplication here is now optional and this class could delegate to
 * contrib and keep only the two additions listed further down. Left as a
 * deliberate follow-up rather than folded into the 3.0 upgrade.
 *
 * The replay: convertEntityConfigToArray() + the recur type's
 * field-plugin calculateInstances() (or the raw custom_dates list for a
 * 'custom' series), fires the same recurring_events_event_instances_pre_create
 * alter contrib fires (so any module reacting to that alter — including this
 * one's own PastPreservingEventInstanceCreator/past-date filtering) sees an
 * identical computed set — and returns the dates without persisting
 * anything.
 *
 * Two additions on top of the raw contrib computation:
 *  - Messenger snapshot/restore: convertEntityConfigToArray()'s callees are
 *    silent, but firing the pre_create alter with a series that is not
 *    actually being created can cause an alter implementation (this module's
 *    own included, since it does not distinguish computation from a real
 *    rebuild) to add a status/warning message meant for a real save. A
 *    dates-only computation must never leak a message onto the current
 *    request; the messenger queue is snapshotted before the alter fires and
 *    restored immediately after, so any message added during compute() is
 *    discarded rather than surfaced to whichever page happens to trigger it.
 *  - Future-only filter: same not-verifiably-past boundary as
 *    RegistrantCounter::endIsNotVerifiablyPast() / PastPreservingEventInstance
 *    Creator::hasEnded() — a past date is dropped from the effective set.
 *
 * FLAGGED-DATE FILTER: filterFlaggedDates() is the ONE function both this
 * class and access_events_recurring_events_event_instances_pre_create_alter()
 * call to drop any computed date whose start exactly matches a preserved
 * flagged (individually_cancelled) instance's start — one function, not two
 * independent derivations of "does this date collide with a flagged
 * instance", so the helper (this class) and the alter (the actual rebuild
 * path) can never drift out of agreement about what counts as a collision.

   *

   * start_date/end_date as DrupalDateTime objects) rather than the widget's
   * pre-conversion shape.
   *
