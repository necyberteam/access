/**
 * Computes the recipient counts and wording behind the moderation-state
 * warnings shown on event edit/moderation forms.
 *
 * This class is computation ONLY: counts, gate reads, and translatable
 * strings. It has no knowledge of Form API — the form_alter implementations
 * in access_events.module call it and place the returned strings into
 * whatever render array shape a given form needs. Keeping the two apart
 * means the same counts and wording appear identically wherever a warning is
 * shown, and this class stays testable without booting a form.
 *
 * Two moderation-state edges each warn:
 *  - LEAVING published (on a currently-published entity being edited away
 *    from published): the event is about to be cancelled and its
 *    not-yet-past registrants notified.
 *  - ARRIVING at published (including a brand-new entity's FIRST publish):
 *    occurrences are about to (re)become live and their not-yet-past
 *    registrants notified. On a series, some previously-scheduled dates may
 *    have already elapsed while the series sat unpublished — those are
 *    reported separately as "skipped" (they will not be (re)created), not
 *    folded into the "will publish" count.
 *
 * Both directions read the SAME notification gates CancellationNotifier
 * checks before it actually queues anything (the site master switch +
 * the notification key's own enabled flag) — see gateOpen(). When a gate is
 * off, the warning still reports the count but states plainly that
 * registrants will NOT be emailed, so an editor is never told a message
 * went out that in fact did not.
